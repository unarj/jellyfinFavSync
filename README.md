My foray into C#, this is a plugin for Jellyfin that will two-way sync any/all user favorites with a playlist.  So hitting the favorite buttoin will add the item to the playlist and/or adding an item to the playlist will favorite it also.  This can be for a single user or all users, in the latetr case all users will get the same "favorites" list.  The frequency of the check and add is controlled in the Scheduled Tasks section of the dashboard.
