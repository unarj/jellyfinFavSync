My foray into C#, this is a plugin for Jellyfin that will two-way sync any/all user favorites with a playlist.  So hitting the favorite button will add the item to the playlist and/or adding an item to the playlist will favorite it also.  This can be for a single user or all users, in the latter case all users will get the same "favorites" list.  If an item appears in either the playlist of favorite list it will be in both, so removing an item can be tricky as it will need to be removed everywhere before the next sync.

The sync frequency is controlled in the Scheduled Tasks section of the dashboard.  The user and playlist name are set in the plugin config page.
